# Clipwise
  
## Project Overview:
I have created a UI website using Next.js (React framework), implementing key features such as:

1.  Error Handling: Effective error management throughout the app.

2. State Management: Utilizing appropriate techniques (e.g., React hooks, Context API, or third-party libraries) to manage state across components.

3. ESLint and Best Coding Practices: Ensuring code quality and consistency using ESLint, while adhering to best practices like modularity, component reusability, and clean architecture.

4. Tailwind CSS & ShadCN UI: Using Tailwind CSS along with ShadCN UI components to style the website based on a given Figma design.

5. Embla Carousel with Autoplay: Leveraging the embla-carousel-autoplay plugin for creating a smooth, autoplaying carousel feature.

6. SVGs: Incorporating SVGs for optimized, scalable graphics.
